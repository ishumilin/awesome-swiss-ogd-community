# Contributing to Awesome Swiss OGD Community

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This list aims to highlight high-quality community-driven projects that make working with Swiss Open Government Data easier and more effective.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone. Here are a few ways you can help:

1.  **Add a new project**: Found a great tool, library, or dataset?
2.  **Update existing entries**: Fix broken links, update descriptions, or add new features.
3.  **Suggest a category**: If you think a new category would help organize the list better.

### Adding a New Project

To add a new project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Check if it fits**: The project should be open-source and related to Swiss OGD. It should ideally be created by an individual contributor or be a community project (not just an official government portal).
2.  **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
3.  **Clone your fork**: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/awesome-swiss-ogd-community.git`
4.  **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b add-my-project`
5.  **Add the link**: Add your project to the appropriate category in `README.md`.
    *   **Format**: `* **[Project Name](URL)** (Language/Tech) - Description.`
    *   **Example**: `* **[swiss-maps](https://github.com/interactivethings/swiss-maps)** (TopoJSON) - Swiss geodata as TopoJSON.`
    *   Keep descriptions concise and informative.
    *   Use alphabetical order within categories if possible.
6.  **Commit and push**:
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Add Project Name"
    git push origin add-my-project
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and click "New Pull Request".

### Guidelines

*   **Quality**: Ensure the project is maintained and useful.
*   **Description**: Should be clear and explain what the tool does.
*   **Language**: Please indicate the primary programming language or technology (e.g., R, Python, JS, QGIS).
